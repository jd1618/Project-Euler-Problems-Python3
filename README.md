# Python Codes

Part 0. Introduction:

This repository is a collection of python codes I have written to solve various problems, such as those issued by Codewars, HackerRank, Project Euler, ect. Since it is not my intention to deprive anyone of their own independent learning, I will only present solutions to the first 100 Project Euler challenges. The later puzzles typically require more creativity and persistence to overcome, which I believe is better appreciated when solved independently or with little guidance. In addition to these codes, data science and machine learning related projects I have worked on will also be uploaded here.
